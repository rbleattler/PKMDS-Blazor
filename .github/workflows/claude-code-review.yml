            Review this pull request and post your findings as a review comment.

            Focus on:
            - Correctness and potential bugs
            - C# and Blazor best practices (nullable reference types, async/await, DI patterns)
            - PKHeX.Core API usage — reference PKHeX WinForms as the authoritative usage guide
            - Performance and memory concerns (WASM constraints apply)
            - Code style consistency with the existing codebase and .editorconfig rules

            Keep feedback constructive and actionable. Note any PKHeX.Core limitations
            as code comments per AGENTS.md guidance.
